        <p>
            I joined the springboard online boot camp in my free time during the COVID-19 lockdown. Initially, this
            project was influenced by the effects I observed by the sudden shift to work from home because of the
            lockdown. As I followed and applied the user-centered design process, my initial reactionary problem was
            converted into something sustainable. Please read the entire article to find out more.

        <p>
            While people are working from home, especially under COVID-19 situations, they are facing issues in
            maintaining group and collaboration work efficiency. I want to explore more about how I might help working
            professionals working from home.

                Secondary Research
            </h2>

            <p>I started to read articles and watch YouTube videos on issues that users are facing working from home,
                and
                about pre-existing solutions, how users are currently coping with the unsolved problem they are facing.

                1. 15 Questions About Remote Work, Answered by Tsedal Neeley <br>
                2. Commentary: COVID-19 could make remote working a permanent feature. That has several implications for
                firms by Anthony Oundjian. <br>
                3. Don’t make these six biggest mistakes if you’re working from home, says the guy who’s done it for ten
                years by Tom Popomaronis. <br>

                Findings and Insights

                1. “Productivity does not have to go down at all. Of course, you might be at home with your partner or
                kids,
                and those issues will need to be worked out.” <br>
                1.1. Although the work efficiency is not getting decreased, users are facing challenges in managing work
                along with their family, which adds more work to the user. <br>
                2. “When you aren’t in the office, there’s usually even less physical activity: No conference meeting
                rooms
                to walk to, no coworkers to go on a coffee run with, and no long hallways that lead to the printer or
                bathroom.” <br>
                2.1. As users are confined to their homes, they don’t have much physical work, which can cause health
                issues. <br>
                3. “This unpredictable transition resulted in early challenges for many organizations, as not everyone
                had
                suitable equipment or settings, and as new working habits needed to be formed.” <br>
                3.1. Users are needed to develop new working habits which they are unfamiliar with.</p>

            <h2>
                User Survey
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once I have acquired some knowledge of working from home, I sent out a survey to find some necessary
                information and to recruit users to do user interviews.

            <h2>
                User Interview
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have conducted five user interviews with users that I have recruited from the user surveys, The main
                aim
                of these user interviews is to find the difference they had while working from home as compared to
                working
                in an office.

                Findings and Insights
            </h4>

            <p>1. Users are not motivated.
                1.1. There is no live peer pressure, and flexibility of time is negatively affecting the user’s
                motivation and
                urgency.
                2. Users don't have a proper workspace at home.
                2.1. Users are finding temporary solutions to cope up with managing a single space for multiple
                activities.
                3. Users are getting distracted.
                3.1. External sources not knowing or not respecting the user’s current state are the primary sources of
                distractions.
                4. Users are getting used to bad/unhealthy habits.
                4.1. Lack of routine causing users to get into bad/unhealthily habits, which they might not even be
                realizing.
                5. Users are delaying work due to external reasons.
                5.1. The work of the user is getting delayed due to inconsistency between the work timings of the team
                members.
                6. Users continue to stay online on work chat groups.
                6.1. Users are getting FOMO because of the isolation from other team members who might even feel the
                same way.</p>

            <h2>User Personas</h2>

            <p>I conduct two rounds of user testing with five testers in each. After iterating after the first time
                again, I have held a second round to make users can use, understand, and like the app. <br><br>
                1. Improved the onboarding process with more explanations. <br>
                2. Divided the making new routine process into two steps so that users won’t get confused between
                activity and routine. <br>
                3. Added new pop up that will pop up when a user clicks on activity block. <br>
                4. Added a little explanation on why a user got a suggestion. <br>
                5. Changed the explore page Name to Routines so that users can understand what the page is about. <br>
                6. Made comparison views optional on Routines page so that the user can easily understand which routine
                <br>
                is from others, and they can then click on compare if they want. <br>
                7. Added a new option give activities priority so that suggestion won't change those activity timings.
                <br>
                8. Added a new option to remind to log user’s activities at specific times. <br>
                9. Added spacing between log and MarkAsDone/Edit Activity to highlight the difference between
                options,which will edit existing activities vs. option, which will add a new activity over the other
                one.
